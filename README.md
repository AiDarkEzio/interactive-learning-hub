# Interactive Learning Hub

A collection of interactive web pages designed to visually explain complex topics discussed on my blog. This repository hosts the code for hands-on simulations that make learning new concepts engaging and intuitive.

## About The Project

This project was created to provide a hands-on learning experience that complements my blog articles. Instead of just reading about complex topics, users can see them in action and interact with them directly. Each page is a standalone HTML file designed to be visually appealing and educational.

The first page, "The Unseen Hand of Randomness," explores concepts like:
*   The Law of Large Numbers
*   Markov Chains
*   The Monte Carlo Method
*   Google's PageRank Algorithm

<!-- ## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser to run these pages. No special software is required.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/aidarkezio/interactive-learning-hub.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```sh
    cd interactive-learning-hub
    ```
3.  Open any of the `.html` files in your browser to view the page. -->

## Project Structure

To keep the project organized as you add more pages, I recommend the following structure:

```
/interactive-learning-hub

├── /randomness-explained
│   └── index.html

├── /assets
│   ├── /css
│   │   ├── style.css
│   │   ├── home.css
│   │   ├── randomness-explained.css

│   │   ├── page-view.js
│   │   ├── randomness-explained.js
│   │   ├── smooth-scrolling.js
│   └── /images

└── README.md
```

<!-- ## How to Add a New Page

- [ ] **Create a New HTML File:** Create a new file, for example, `new-concept.html`, in the root directory.
- [ ] **Develop Your Content:** Use the existing `randomness-explained.html` as a template for structure and styling.
- [ ] **Add Your Code:** Write the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create your new interactive simulation.
- [ ] **Link from Your Blog:** After pushing the new file to GitHub, it will be available at `https://aidarkezio.github.io/interactive-learning-hub/new-concept.html`.
- [ ] **Update the README:** Add your new page to the list in the "About The Project" section of this README. -->
